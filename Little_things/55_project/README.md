    1. **Modularization**: LESS allows breaking down styles into reusable components, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
    2. **Variables**: Common values like colors, font sizes, and spacing can be stored in variables for consistency and easier updates.
    3. **Nesting**: LESS enables nested rules to reflect the structure of HTML, improving readability and reducing repetitive code.
    4. **Mixins**: Reusable blocks of styles can be created, such as gradients or button styles, which are applied across the project.
    5. **Functions**: LESS supports functions to generate dynamic styles.
