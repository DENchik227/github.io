            <q class="card__text" cite="Daniel Clifford">I received a job offer mid-course, and
                the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got
                every penny&apos;s worth.</q>
            <q class="card__story">I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                bootcamp. I&apos;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
                experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course, I&apos;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
                VR startup.</q>

            <q class="card__text" cite="Kira Whittle">Such a life-changing experience. Highly
                recommended!</q>
            <q class="card__story" cite="Kira Whittle">Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve
                never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
                wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
                fact, I&apos;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                recommend!</q>

                the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and
                amazing people.</q>
